# Trackkonize 🛰️  
Project & Employee Management System (Dummy Version)

**Trackkonize** is a Laravel-based web application developed during my BCA internship at *Infomax Digital LLP*.

- ✅ **Fully functional project assignment** to employees  
- ✅ **Leave application and approval system**  
- ❌ **Static employee tracking module** (dummy/demo data)
